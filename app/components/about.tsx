                Fusion Senior Care Home Plus is based in Wichita, Kansas. We are
                a family-owned company established in 2016. Owner/operator
                Syreeta Chenneh-Dweh was inspired to open our first home by the
                compassionate, resourceful nurse who cared for her dying mother.
                Through sacrifice and excellence, our first two residents
                experienced improvement in their quality of life. As the word
                spread, the founders soon had a full house and eventually a
                waiting list.
              </p>

              <p>
                Starting from that first home at 512 N. Bebe, we now have a
                portfolio of 4 home plus locations. We plan to open more homes
                to serve Wichitaâ€™s growing senior population.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wichita families have trusted us to care for their loved ones
                for almost a decade because of our unwavering commitment to
                quality care and our wealth of experience.
              </p>
